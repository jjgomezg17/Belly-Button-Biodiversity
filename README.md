# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview of Project

### In this project, I was tasked with completing four technical analysis deliverables. This included the creation of a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, a gauge chart, and the customization of the dashboard. To achieve these objectives, I utilized JavaScript libraries such as D3 and Plotly to generate the charts. Additionally, I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of the dashboard. My understanding of data visualization techniques and expertise with these tools enabled me to successfully complete the project and provide valuable insights to the users.
